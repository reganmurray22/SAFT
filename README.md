### Description
Welcome to Movie Hub! Where you can expand your movie horizons at the click of a button. We have a diverse selection of films you can search through by title, but if you want something more specific we provide that. Once you select a film you are able to also look for specific actors, directors and genres to influence what we recommend for you at the bottom of the page. We provide up to 3 suggestions based off what you are looking for, and from there you will be able to select the new film of your choice and fall down the rabbit hole of cinema. Who knows you may find something new that you've never heard of before.

This ranges from Actors starring in your favorite film, to the Director if you like their work, or if you want something a little more general you can explore through Genres.

We utilized  Materialize UI components to construct an attractive, consistent, and functional web app, while adhering to modern web design principles such as browser portability and making it responsive to a wide variety of devices. Additionally we utilized the Open Movie Database (link above) as a resource to provide the movie data that is requested by the user to populate our application with posters, release dates, ratings and extra detail on the cast and crew. We also utilized The Movie Database (link above) in conjunction with the Open Movie Database to provide more details on actors, directors and genres.
