## Movie Hub
### The Problem:
Our movie viewing habits have seen some dramatic changes in the past few months.  Streaming video on-demand was already having a huge impact on the industry, but now, with viewers stuck at home due to COVID, more and more of us are turning to streaming content to fill our time. As a result, streaming platforms have seen a dramatic increase in viewership since March. Streaming platforms such as Netflix and Hulu have allowed us to collect movies, old and new, and save them to our watchlists, but now that we are going through content at a faster rate, what happens when you reach the end of your wacthlist? If only there were an app that could help...

### The Solution: Movie Hub!
Welcome to Movie Hub! Where you can expand your movie horizons at the click of a button. Movie Hub allows users to use movies theyâ€™ve already seen and loved, to search for what they want to watch next! Who knows, you may find something new that you've never heard of before... 

### Live Site
[Movie Hub](https://reganmurray22.github.io/SAFT/)

### Usage
To start our app think of a favorite film and enter it into the search bar. First you will be given the details of this film such as release date, cast, rating and a short plot summary, then as a bonus, you can then search for related films based on the actors, director or genre of that film.  Movie Hub will generate a list of movies based on your search criteria and provide you with three random choices from that list. You can then either get information from one of the three selections, refresh for three new choices using the same search criteria, or use one of the random selections to garner a new search, and thus fall down a rabbit hole of cinema! Thanks to Movie Hub, you can expand your movie horizons with countless movies to watch. 

### Api's Used
For our main content, the two APIs used in the construction of Movie Hub are OMDB and TheMovieDB both of which are examples of RESTful APIs, which use URLs and HTTP protocol, and JSON for their data format.

 #### [Open Movie Database](http://www.omdbapi.com/): 
 We chose this API for its extensive list of movies and its ease of use.  An API call can be made simply using the name of the film, and the feedback will include its details such as plot, title, cast and more.
 #### [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api):
 With the information collected from the first API, we could then use TheMovieDB to convert the actors, directors, and genres to numerical IDs, and finally to search and compile a list of movies associated with those IDs.
  
 
 
### CSS
MaterializeCSS was utilized for the project for all CSS needs, [MaterializeCSS](https://materializecss.com/about.html). Materialize is a library created with CSS, JavaScript and HTML. We chose Materialize not only for its ability to create an attractive, consistent, and functional web app, while adhering to modern web design principles such as browser portability and multi-device responsiveness, but also for its UI components which simplify and enhance our user's experience. 

A Special Thanks for Team Apricots for making the SAFT project a dream into reality.

And thanks to you the user!

Have fun expanding your movie horizons!
